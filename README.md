# Flashlight firmware, written in rust

This is flashlight firmware for the lume1-6af (attiny1616), written in Rust.

The UI is (read: will be) inspired by the
[And√∫ril](https://github.com/ToyKeeper/anduril) firmware

## EMBASSY on an attiny1616

This is some messing around with embassy on AVR (attiny1616)

The time driver ticks at 64hz and I've modified embassy to use a u32 tick
counter, which at 64hz won't overflow for just enough time for this to be useful
to me
